		<h1>Who is NIKI?</h1> 
		<hr>
		<p>NIKI, whose real name is Niki Zefanya, is a singer that was born in Jakarta, Indonesia. Her singing career took off when she was 15; that was when she won the Cornetto Ride to Fame contest, which was organized by Walls (an ice cream company) and Taylor Swift. As her reward, she was able to sing the opening act at Taylor Swift's tour in Jakarta. Afterwards, she started sharing more of her music on youtube till,in 2018, she signed with record label 88rising when she came to the United States.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>At 18, she came to the US to further her career in music by attending Lipscomb University in Tennessee for music. However, after singing with 88rising, she moved to LA. Aside from going on tour, NIKI has composed music for Marvel's Sang-Chi film.</p>
		
		<br> 
		<p>I chose to make a website on NIKI cause I'm also Indonesian and I like listening to her music. I think that she's skilled in her work given how she started at a young age. Also, I think her willingness to move away from home to puruse her career and being successful is a good example of hard work.</p>
